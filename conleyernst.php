				        During my short career as a computer scientist I have worked at two different startups: Shareaholic and Drift. Both of the Boston based companies develop web applications. I hope to work as a software engineer this upcoming summer and continue my professional development.

				        I also have worked on campus here at the University of Rochester. I am currently a Meridian, aka a tour guide. I give both regular and engineering campus tours. I have also previously worked as a TA for the department of computer science.

				        Outside of the classroom I am on the Varsity Lacrosse Team and hold a position on the executive board of my sorority. Iâ€™ve played lacrosse since I was in fourth grade and am goalie on the team here at UR. In my sorority I have held the executive board position as Panhellenic Delegate and currently serve as Risk Management chairwoman. Additionally, I have held executive council positions of Chapter Historian and Sunshine Chair. Lastly, I am a recruitment counselor (Rho Gamma) for the Panhellenic Association.

				        I came in as a freshman with the intent of majoring in Digital Media Studies and Environmental Science. As a result, I spent my freshman year taking mainly Biology and Chemistry courses. The spring semester of my freshman year I took CSC 161 in order to fulfill a Digital Media Studies Requirement; this was my first introduction programming. Though I went in with the attitude that I was going to hate it, I ended up falling in love with programming and ended up switching my second major to Computer Science.
